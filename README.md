# emissions
A project built using Angular front-end and Laravel back-end.

When ready, it will do the following: 
1. Ask the user what emissions-data she wants to obtain.
2. Provide filters to enable the user to post a specific query.
3. Fetch the required data from the [Emissions API](https://api.v2.emissions-api.org/ui/).
4. Use bar charts or similar graphical tools to show the **analysis-ready** results.
